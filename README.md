This is my first big Project, which I created with a bunch of other students as a semester Project.
It won the third place out of 40 Projects.
Now its just a Showcase, because the JavaScript API from Google would cost, so you are only able to see the developer Map but it works!
Have Fun with it here: https://murtl.github.io/studienprojekt-ss22/
